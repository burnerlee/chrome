# iCapture

iCapture is a Chrome extension that allows users to capture any audio while attending an online meeting, video or podcast. Multiple tabs can be captured simultaneously. The software returns a text transcript to the audio and also gives useful analysis on the text

Chrome Audio Capture is available in the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-audio-capture/kfokdmfpdnokpmpbjhjbcabgligoelgp)
